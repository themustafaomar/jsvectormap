### What's an interactive map?
- Interactive map is a powerful tool for presentation.
- It give the ability to create layers of information that can be shown or hidden at the click of a button on a region or maybe a marker.
- Data can be quickly updated, and these updates made transparent to users.
- Zoom functions that allow users to focus on either the details of a particular region, or to gain a quick overview of a wider area.
